# Securing-Compute-Engine-Applications-and-Resources-using-BeyondCorp-Enterprise
In this project, I secure compute engine applications and resources.

## Overview
In this project, I work on securing a Compute Engine workloads using BeyondCorp Enterpriseâ€™s Identity Aware Proxy to restrict traffic based on identity.
The project hosted on Google Cloud Console provisions a web based IDE that I will restrict access to via zero trust configuration that I enable in this project.
Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) is a feature of Google Cloud's BeyondCorp Enterprise that helps secure access to Google Cloud resources and applications. 
IAP is a zero-trust solution that allows employees to access web applications from anywhere without a VPN.
IAP uses a user's identity and the context of a request to determine if they should be allowed access

## Objectives
In this project, I will:
Configure OAuth Consent.
Setup OAuth access credentials.
Setup IAP access for the deployed application.
Restrict access to the application using Identity Aware Proxy (IAP).
